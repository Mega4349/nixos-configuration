# nixos-configuration
My NixOS configuration using Flakes. May or may not work, very scuffed and still a constant work in progress, I'm learning as I go. 

todo:<br> 
	greeter gtk theme<br>
	tmux theme<br>
	swaync colors<br>
	spicetify flake<br>
	wine fonts<br>
	replace exec commands with services<br>
