# nixos-configuration
My NixOS configuration using Flakes. May or may not work, very scuffed and still a constant work in progress, I'm learning as I go. 

todo:<br> 
	swaync colors<br>
	spicetify flake<br>
	wine fonts<br>
	maybe script for installing flatpaks<br>
	hardcoded paths for images<br>
	use agenix for secrets<br>
