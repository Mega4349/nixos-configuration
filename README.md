# nixos-configuration
My NixOS configuration using Flakes. May or may not work, very scuffed and still a constant work in progress, I'm learning as I go. 

todo:<br> 
	wine fonts<br>
	maybe script for installing flatpaks<br>
	hardcoded paths for images<br>
	use agenix for secrets<br>
	before-sleep swayidle event<br>
